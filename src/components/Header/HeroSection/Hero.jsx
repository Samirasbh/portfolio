        Follow your heart, it will lead you to heaven.
        I listened to the whisper of my soul and it showed me the path where the gates of bliss lay.
        I started to create my dream world on canvas
        And I nurtured the unlimited space of the sky in my mind to create my artwork.
        i named my collection SKYART , i hope you enjoy it. 
        </p>
